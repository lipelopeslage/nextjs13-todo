# Simple Next.js 13 Todo App

This is a learning exercise by the channel [Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgayZAuTgwM) applying TailWind CSS and Server Actions at the recent released Next.js 13 version. This app uses [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) for data persistence with Typescript.


## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).


First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
